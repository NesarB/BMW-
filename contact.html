    <h2>The M5 model was designed by Karl John Elmitt and produced at the BMW Plant Dingolfing in Germany. The E60 M5 did not offer safety features such as automatic radar braking or lane departure warning, which was offered on the E60 5 Series that were not on the M5.The BMW M5 Competition Sedan includes the M Sport exhaust system with distinctive black tailpipes - a perfect complement to other black elements, including the kidney grille, mirror caps, side gills, and more.</h2>
