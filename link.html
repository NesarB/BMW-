    <h2> Space and light are two of the most essential elements of luxury, and the BMW M5 offers both in spades. The windows and doors are large, making visibility, ingress, and egress easy. As alluded to earlier, the 5 Series has grown over the years and is now the perfect size. Front passengers get 41.4 inches of legroom and 40.7 inches of headroom. The rear legroom is ample at 36.5 inches, and the headroom is more than enough at 38.5 inches.

        The center rear seat is wide enough to accommodate Slenderman, but the transmission tunnel means there's virtually nowhere for him to put his legs. You could put someone there for a short trip, but the M5 works much better as a four-seater.</h2>
